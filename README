Chpok!
======

I created this game just for fun. It is based on PhoneGap framework,
so you may build it not only for iOS but for Android too.

Game is about popping bubbles on plastic packaging tape.

You can find "Chpok" game in AppStore:
http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/chpok!/id504498900?ls=1&mt=8

To debug it on the desktop, uncomment
//onDeviceReady()
and comment out device-dependent function calls.

If you plan to build it in XCode, you should have "SoundPlug" plugin
for PhoneGap (can be found on here github).
Or just comment out sound playing.

Stay cool
